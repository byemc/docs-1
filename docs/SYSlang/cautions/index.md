# Monitor class precautions
The first type of precautions are for the most consuming part of SYSlang, it's GUI. Some precautions can save entire PC's, so use them wisely!

As safety comes first, we highly recommend setting a resourceLevel. This specific precaution is largely forgotten by even the devs that made the lang, but can save _hundreds_ of dolars and _thousands_ of lives. Monitor provides this feature by default, but it's not set to anything until it's called. To call it, just type `monitor.setResourceLevel(auto)`. This case will automate the use of resources and will adjust the ventilators, clock timings and, depending on your PC build, even adjust the frequency that your CPU or RAM run at.

This can be extremely useful for saving PC's, especially if you don't know how much weight your app will have on devices.

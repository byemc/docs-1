Welcome to the SYSlang Section of the Docs! This section is written by V1RU5. This guide will teach you all the basics of SYSlang along with the complex definitions of the different libraries and some code examples!


I would like to thank the following people:
- Team Molecule for the entire homebrew scene
- redir110 for writing the basic Wiki
- My secretary, Juile, for proof reading
- And, of course, PipeWarp, for allowing me to give a home to my docs on his [site](https://docs.pipewarp.co.uk/)!!


# To follow along in this guide, you will need:
* A PC (preferably running Windows)
* Decent Knowledge in Lua, as the language is very similar
* An internet connection
* Some free time

_This guide is separated in two halves: The language, and the OS._

Have fun using SYSlang!

# Hello World in SYSlang


### huh, y so long?

## This section is _once again_ for the very new users of SYSl

Welcome to the first tutorial on this site.

In this tutorial you'll learn:
* How to use the `nogui` class to 'write' text in a CLI.
* How other 'write' functions work.
* How to make a small, yet functional text-based welcoming system for entering a new username.

## Before you start:
This tutorial is designed for _new_ users using SYStemware's Coderttop, or SYSlang's CLI on Windows/Linux.

## Part 1: Making the new save file
To make a new file (and to overwrite it in the near future) type `savefile` and type the name afterwards.
By default Script's will be saved in the same folder as the CLI is in.

To save the open file as a new file, use `savefile.new()` and type the new name in the brackets.

## Part 2: Writing the new file out
Once you have successfully saved the file, to start typing code inside use `editscript()` and type the file name in the brackets.

While here on CMD or Terminal in Windows or Linux, there will be **no** auto corrector or code checker.

Start typing your code, here is a nice example to get a basic hello world written on the screen:
```
error 404: file not found
```
